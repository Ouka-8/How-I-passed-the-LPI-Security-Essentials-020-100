# How-I-passed-the-LPI-Essentials-010-160
Sharing my roadmap, notes, and resources that helped me pass the LPIC Essentials (010-160) exam, so you can learn from and adapt them to your own study style.

On this September evening in 2025, the air holds steady at 79 degrees. Neither oppressive nor cool, but balanced, as if the day itself is holding its breath. I sit here writing, not yet a passer of the exam. 
That might sound bold one might even say misleading—but it isn’t.

Let me explain.

This journey is not about pretending to already have the victory. It is about walking you through each step I take, the actions I practice, and the methods I test as I work toward passing. 
When this process closes, I trust that success will be the natural outcome of these efforts.

But here’s the truth: not everyone learns the same way. What works for me might not be the perfect fit for you. 
If, you find my path doesn’t serve you, I encourage you to pursue the study rhythm, tools, and habits that help you thrive.
